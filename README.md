# Button Debounce

 Pushbuttons often generate improper open/close transitions when pressed, due to mechanical and physical issues: these transitions may be read as multiple presses in a very short time fooling the program, without debouncing, pressing the button once may cause unpredictable results.

This library will sample the button repeatedly; and if it sees the button in its new state for 8 consequtive checks (equally spaced within 'delay' milli seconds) -- will report the state as changed.

 Usage
============

## SETUP


Declare a `ButtonDebouce` object with `pinNumber` and `timeMillis` to debounce as parameter, and defined a callback function.

Example:

```
void onButtonChange(const int state) {
  Serial.println("Changed: " + String(state));
}
ButtonDebounce button(3, 250); // PIN 3 with 250ms debounce time
button.setCallback(onButtonChange);
```

Or - in a more asynchroneous style:

```
void onButtonChange(const int state) {
  Serial.println("Changed: " + String(state));
}
ButtonDebounce button(3, 250); // PIN 3 with 250ms debounce time
button.setCallback([](const int state) {
  Serial.println("Changed: " + String(state));
});
```

Important: buttons donÂ´t share resources. The following methods are avaliable.

* `state()` return the last button state.
* `setCallback(function)` set the callback function that will executed on button state changes.

Note that the constructor also sets the INPUT_PULLUP pinmode() on the pin.
## LOOP

The loop can be empty; the updating is done behind the scenes. 

```
void loop() {
}
```
